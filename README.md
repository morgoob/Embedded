# Embedded Projects Repository

Welcome to the Embedded Projects repository! This collection includes projects related to Embedded Systems. Below are the subdirectories along with a brief description of each. For detailed information, please refer to their respective README files.

## 1. FreeRTOS Fundamentals

Explore fundamental examples of Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOS) using FreeRTOS. Projects cover tasks, prioritization, and preemption.

- [**Projects**](FreeRTOS/FreeRTOS_Fundamentals/README.md): Brief examples of FreeRTOS implementations.
- [**Getting Started**](FreeRTOS/FreeRTOS_Fundamentals/README.md): Set up the ESP32 on the Arduino IDE.
- [**Contributing**](FreeRTOS/FreeRTOS_Fundamentals/README.md): Contribute, report errors, or suggest improvements.
- [**Author**](FreeRTOS/FreeRTOS_Fundamentals/README.md): Morgan Lloyd.

## 2. BLE Accelerometer Sensor Monitor

Monitor data from an accelerometer and sensors over Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). Provides real-time information about movement, obstacle detection, and accelerometer data.

- [**Projects**](BLE_Accelerometer_Sensor_Monitor/README.md): Arduino script for BLE sensor monitoring.
- [**Requirements**](BLE_Accelerometer_Sensor_Monitor/README.md): Hardware and libraries needed.
- [**Configuration**](BLE_Accelerometer_Sensor_Monitor/README.md): Steps to set up and upload the script.
- [**BLE Services**](BLE_Accelerometer_Sensor_Monitor/README.md): Service UUID and characteristics.

Feel free to explore each subdirectory for detailed project information and instructions!
